I started my journey at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro studying Engraving ([UFRJ](https://eba.ufrj.br)). I also take classes in Computer Science, where I became part of the junior computer enterprise, [EJCM](https://ejcm.com.br). Where I had experiences with mobile development for android and IOS, as well as the opportunity to manage a project from software prioritization to final execution.
