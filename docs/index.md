# Farno thoughts is the personal web site  of Fábio R. Nóbrega

 I am a software developer of web systems with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I currently use a Vue.JS framework with Nuxt.Js and I have experience with Ruby on Rails and Node.JS (with TypeORM) on backend. I started my journey at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro studying Engraving ([UFRJ](https://eba.ufrj.br)). I also take classes in Computer Science, where I became part of the junior computer enterprise, [EJCM](https://ejcm.com.br). Where I had experiences with mobile development for android and IOS, as well as the opportunity to manage a project from software prioritization to final execution. I am currently at [lemoneyway](https://lemoneyway.com/en/) where I work as a developer getting deeper and deeper into good programming practices and solving challenges in the cashback market. And I m collaboration on Computer Science museum from UFRJ. To time to time i create some projects for arduino.
